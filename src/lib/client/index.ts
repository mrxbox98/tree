It thrives in partial shade, especially with morning sun and afternoon shade, making it one of the few roses that adapt well to less direct sunlight. While it can tolerate full sun, partial shade often enhances its performance. Cooler, shaded conditions can also deepen the violet hue of its blooms, enriching their color.\n\nSoil\nThis heirloom rose prefers well-drained, loamy soil enriched with organic matter.\n\nWater\nRegular watering is essential, particularly during hot, dry periods.

These pests can damage foliage, flowers, and stems, reducing the plant’s vigor.\nDisease Resistance\nRoses are susceptible to several fungal diseases, including rose black spot, rust, and powdery mildew. These diseases often thrive in humid conditions, causing leaf discoloration, defoliation, or stem dieback. Disorders like rose blindness (failure to bloom) and flower balling (petals failing to open) may also occur under certain conditions. In severe cases, honey fungus, a soil-borne pathogen, can damage the plant’s root system.\nPrevention and Care\nRegular monitoring, proper pruning, and ensuring good air circulation can minimize risks. Applying organic pest control measures and treating fungal infections early with fungicides are essential to maintaining healthy roses.\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                Buy Rosa ‘Reine des Violettes’ (Hybrid Perpetual Rose)                            \n                        \n                        \n                            \n    \n        \n            Add to Collection        \n\n        \n            Add to Any Collection\n            My Collection        \n    \n\n                            \n                        \n                            Buy Plants\n                        \n                                                    \n                                \n                                    Compare All Rosa - Shrub Rose                                \n                            \n                                                                        \n                "

The shiny green leaves are lanceolate, 2-5 in. long (5-12 cm), finely toothed along the margins, and paler green below. They flutter in the breeze, creating a rippling bicolored effect. Shining Willow is dioecious with separate male and female plants. In mid to late spring, fuzzy catkins appear with or before the leaves. The pollen-releasing male catkins are yellow, while the seed-producing catkins are green. Seeds are tiny and embedded in a mass of tangled hairs that lifts and carries the seeds away on the air currents. Native to the western and southwestern United States, Shining Willow grows in wet to moist sites at middle to high elevations. Fast-growing, cold-hardy, Shining Willow can be used as a specimen, in group planting, near bodies of water, as an informal hedge, or as a deciduous screen. Its suckering habit aids in erosion control and makes it useful for stabilizing streambanks and improving wildlife habitat. The catkins are a source of pollen for beneficial insects and the catkins and buds are food for small game and songbirds in spring. Shining Willow is a host plant for the Mourning Cloak, Acadian Hairsteaks, Admirals. It is recommended for restoration projects and is easily propagated.\n\nGrows up to 10-30 ft. tall (3-9 m) and 10-25 ft. wide (3-8 m). Adds 36 in. per year (90 cm).\nPerforms best in full sun to part shade, in moist to wet soils. Can withstand seasonal flooding.\nGood for hedges and screens, wildlife gardens, or along streams or ponds.\nKeep an eye out for anthracnose, willow blight, armillaria, phytophthora, aphids, beetle borers, caterpillars, spider mites, Verticillium.\nShining willow is distributed from Alaska east to Labrador and south to California, Kansas, and North Carolina.\n\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                Buy Salix lasiandra (Shining Willow)                            \n                        \n                        \n                            \n    \n        \n            Add to Collection        \n\n        \n            Add to Any Collection\n            My Collection        \n    \n\n                            \n                        \n                            Buy Plants\n                        \n                                                    \n                                \n                                    Compare All Salix                                \n                            \n                                                                        \n                "

        "textContent": "\n                    Betula populifolia, commonly known as Gray Birch, is a deciduous tree that’s part of the Betulaceae family. It is recognized for its slender, upright habit and distinctive white bark.\nBetula populifolia: An In-depth Look\nNative: This birch species is native to eastern North America, particularly in regions from Quebec to Minnesota and south to Virginia, where it is typically found in both dry and wet soils.\nPlant Type and Habit: Gray Birch is a deciduous tree with an upright, narrow, columnar profile. It most often appears in a multi-trunked form, but also grows with a single trunk.\nSize: Typically reaching heights of 20 to 40 feet (6-12 meters) and a spread of 10 to 20 feet (3-6 meters), it’s considered a small to medium-sized tree.\nFlowers: The tree produces inconspicuous catkins, which are pendulous for males and more upright for females. The catkins usually bloom from late spring to early summer.\nFruits: After blooming, the tree produces tiny winged nutlets that are wind-dispersed.\nFoliage: Gray Birch has shiny, long-pointed triangular green leaves, 3 inches long (7 cm), with a doubly serrate margin. The foliage turns a beautiful yellow in the fall.\nBark: It is generally smooth and light gray to white in color. Unlike the peeling layers commonly associated with other birch species, the bark of Gray Birch tends to remain tight to the trunk and does not peel. Its distinctive bark makes it a particularly attractive choice for winter interest in the garden.\nHardiness: This tree is fairly hardy, suitable for USDA Zones 3-6. It is also more tolerant of poor, dry soils compared to other birches.\nUses: Due to its slender form, it’s often used as an ornamental tree. It’s also suitable for small landscapes and can be used in reclamation projects.\nWildlife: Gray Birch, is an asset to local ecosystems, offering nourishment and refuge to a range of wildlife. Songbirds, ground birds, and mammals are drawn to this tree for its seeds and sheltering branches. It also serves as a larval host for the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, contributing to butterfly biodiversity.\nDeer and Rabbits: Generally less palatable to deer, although not entirely deer-resistant. Rabbits may nibble at the lower branches.\nToxicity: There are no significant toxicity issues for humans or pets.\nInvasiveness: Betula populifolia is not considered invasive; it usually coexists well with native plant species.\nBenefits:  The tree can be used for its ornamental value, for erosion control, and as a source of food and habitat for wildlife. Its wood, although not of high commercial value, can be used for pulp.\nKey Facts: Gray Birch is often one of the first trees to colonize disturbed areas, making it important in succession planting. Also noteworthy is its relatively quick growth rate and short lifespan, often no longer than 30-50 years.\nHow to Grow and Care for a Gray Birch\nLight: Prefers full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.\nSoil: Adaptable to various soil types including clay, loam, and sand. Tolerant of slightly alkaline to acidic conditions, and can even handle occasional wetness as long as the soil is well-drained.\nWater: Moderately drought-tolerant but prefers consistent moisture. Water deeply, especially during dry periods.\nFertilizer: Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring before new growth starts. Avoid excessive nitrogen.\nPruning: Best to prune in late fall or winter when the tree is dormant. Avoid pruning between May and August to deter the bronze birch borer.\nPropagation: Propagate through seeds or cuttings. Seeds should be sown in a cold frame as soon as they are ripe.\nPests and Diseases: Keep an eye out for Bronze Birch Borer, Birch Leafminer, Aphids, Leaf Spot, Powdery Mildew and Canker.\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                Buy Betula populifolia (Gray Birch)                            \n                        \n                        \n                            \n    \n        \n            Add to Collection        \n\n        \n            Add to Any Collection\n            My Collection        \n    \n\n                            \n                        \n                            Buy Plants\n                        \n                                                    \n                                \n                                    Compare All Betula                                \n                            \n                                                                        \n                "
